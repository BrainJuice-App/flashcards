* Once on your profile page, you can edit your information and even submit a photo to your page! Hit 'Submit' to be taken back to your profile page and notice the changes.
* On profile, you can also click 'Create Card' to add a custom flashchard! Simply fill out the form and hit 'Submit', you will be redirected to the home screen. All your custom cards will render at random with the developers' cards!
